Berry Email Modal

Link - https://berrymodal.netlify.app/

I have built an email modal. The purpose of an email modal is to receive emails from users of a website.

The modal consists of a call to action informing viewers of the services Berry has to offer. The modal appears when the mouse or cursor has left the screen. There is a form where users can enter their email. After this information is entered, the user will click the send button and a thank you page will appear. The user has the option to not enter anything by clicking the "Sorry, I'm not interested" link below the form or by clicking the close button located in the top right part of the page. Both of these options will close the modal.


Here is an image of the email modal:

and an image of the thank you message:
